My Rails project was quite a struggle. I had fallen a bit behind in my lessons/labs and was rushing right up until the start of the project. So, I went into the project not feeling too confident and quite shaky on many of the concepts. Now that I have finished I feel much, much better about how to build a rails app. Especially with associations, since that was a very weak area for me.

The project did not end up being excactly what I set out to do, but it is a functional app that allows a teacher to create a course with students, the parents students and after those things have been accomplished, a parent/teacher conference. I am content with the finished product and I think that it might be something that I can come back to in the future to improve and build upon.

I included authentication and authorization. I  learned quite a bit and after some long days and nights struggling through the concepts I feel pretty good about my foundational rails skills. I learned a ton through this process and feel that I have a solid ground to build on. 

One thing, I wish I had done a bit more of is including partials and helpers. I have one partial that I used and a few of the common helpers (authenticate, current user, etc) but I wish I had created some more of my own custom helpers.

One thing I learned that I really found helpful was the usage of the built-in rails helper before_action. That was so helpful for the authenticate feature. The more and more I learn about these common helpers, the more I love Rails!

All in all, a tough two weeks but well worth the gains in the end!

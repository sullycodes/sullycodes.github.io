I kept it simple for this project as I didnot want to get in over my head. I separtated the backend and the frontend. My . app generates a random story from a pre-determined array of stories. The user then can pick a character or more and add to the story. These are also generated randonmly.

The user then can see a list of there chosen stories and delete them if they wish

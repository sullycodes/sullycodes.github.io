I decided to learn to program because I love to build, create, and solve problems. I have some exprerience with front-end web development, having been a graphic designer/web developer for a few years in my 20s. I enjoy a good mental challege and feel a deep reward when I can solve or make something.

I am a math and science teacher currently, so some of these elements are present in my day job, but nearly as much as in the world of software engineering. I am very much looking forward to having a full-time career as a software engoneer someday. I am really enjoying learning Ruby and am excited about all of the new things store.

After having completed several projects in FlatIron School's Sotware Engineering program, I have learned the value of planning and pseudo-coding before plunging into a project head first. Taking the time to throughly plan out what it is you intend to produce, in the end, saves time and promotes higher quality coding minutes. 

If you are like me, when you get a big picture idea and get excited about it you want to hit the ground running and start with the fun stuff - the code. However, as I learned with my first two projects - the CLI and Sinatra projects - this might lead you into a world of sloppiness and eventual confusion rife with errors and loads of debugging stress. I was able to right the ship eventually with these projects and pass the assessments, but I learned some tough lessons that cost me time and efficiency.

So here is what I like to do now when builiding a web app:

* Make a rough sketch of its pages (or at least the home page with general layout, navbar, etc)

* Watch a tutorial or two of how someone else built something similar

* Build out the basic framework of pages (or components with React)

* Type in pseudo-code at the top of each page what this page or component will do

* Start coding from the beginning of the user experience (home page, then create new whatever, etc)

* Insert psedo-code as needed for functions not yet created

* Then, code until it works! 

One other practice that has been helpful to me is recognizing when to walk away. I have found myself anguishing over an issue that at that moment in time seems unsolvable. I have found that when I reach these points of frustration  that it helps immensely to distance myself for a solid chink of time. By clearing my head and directing my attention to another matter, I find when I come back to the matter at hand with a fresh mind and a more relaxed state that I almost allows find the solution I was looking for. It really works!

That's basically it. Pretty simple and straightforward, but extremely helpful for to prevent impulsively plowing forward. These steps allow me to patiently and systematically program at an optimal level that works for me. And this, naturally, allows me,  in due time, to get to the good stuff without having to deal as much with the bad stuff (bugs, crashes, etc) as a result of hasty, subpar planning.

After having completed several projects in FlatIron School's Sotware Engineering program, I have learned the value of planning and pseudo-coding before plunging into a project head first. Taking the time to throughly plan out what it is you intend to produce, in the end, saves time and promotes higher quality coding minutes. 

If you are like me, when you get a big picture idea and get excited about it you want to hit the ground running and start with the fun stuff - the code. However, as I learned with my first two projects - the CLI and Rails projects - this might lead you into a world of sloppiness and eventual confusion. I was able to right the ship eventually with these projects and pass the assessments but I learned some tough lessons that cost me time and efficiency.

So here is what I like to do now when builiding a web app:

* Make a rough sketch of its pages (or at least the home page with general layout, navbar, etc)
* Watch a tutorial or two of how someone else built something similar
* Build out the basic framework of pages (or components with react)
* Type in pseudo-code at the top of each page what this page or component will do
* Start coding from the beginning of the user experience (home page, then create new whatever, etc)


That's basically it. Pretty simple and straightforward, but extremely helpful to prevent impulsively plowing forward to get to the good stuff but then having to deal with the bad stuff (bugs, crashes, etc) as a result of this subpar planning.
